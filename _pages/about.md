  <p>To deliver the news, faithfully framed by the Bible.</p>

  <p>
    There is nothing new under the sun, so to properly analyze the news is to describe what has already been revealed long ago by God in holy scripture (Ecc 1:9-10, 3:15, 6:10).
  </p>

  <p>
    While other Christian news sources write stories that may interest Christians, perhaps mentioning a verse or two along the way, The Lamp goes deeper by explaining what scripture has to teach us about current events. We strive to enrich the daily news of the world while strengthening the readerâ€™s biblical knowledge and faith.
  </p>

  <p>
    We don't just cover stories traditionally related to the Christian faith, such as conservative politics, hot-button social issues like LGBTQ and abortion, denominational church matters, end-times prophecy and the modern state of Israel. While those are important subjects, we also deliver timely coverage of the full range of newsworthy events from a strictly biblical worldview, faithfully conforming our perspective to scriptural doctrine in order to teach and edify. By using the news of the world as a topical platform for expository preaching and daily devotion, we enable Christians to study God's word while they catch up on current events. This is very much a ministry for our brothers and sisters in Christ Jesus, to build up His church and glorify His name.
  </p>

  <p>
    Readers of The Lamp can expect to find the full spectrum of breaking news in areas like politics, international affairs, business, crime, entertainment, science, technology and the news media itself&mdash;all with a biblical focus centered around the gospel of Jesus Christ. Of course, as a Christian news organization, we also cover the usual Christian beats.
  </p>

  <h5>Biblical News Analysis</h5>

  <p>
    The Lamp is pioneering an entirely unique approach to Christian journalism. We call our journalistic approach Biblical News Analysis (BNA). While the unbeliever may consider articles written using BNA to constitute mere opinion (Christian opinion, as it were), the intent of BNA is to render quite the opposite result (Prv 3:5-6). Indeed, we maintain that objective truth is found only in the word of God and can be known by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, and everything else constitutes the mere opinions of men (2Pe 1:20-21). Our spiritual and journalistic mission, then, is to take every subjective perception and thought captive to the obedience of Christ, so that the truth may be revealed to those with ears to hear it (2Co 10:3-6).
  </p>

  <p>
    You'll find some of our articles to be highly critical of other media sources, and that's because the Bible condemns the godless worldview that frames their stories. It's nothing personal. We believe that proper analysis of world events involves an analysis of how the world interprets those events in contrast to the Bible, and since the primary objective of BNA is to provide the biblical perspective that's missing in secular media, the articles featured on The Lamp often involve stern but Bible-based criticism of the news media itself. As ambassadors for Christ, we speak the truth boldly as we ought to speak (2Co 5:20, Eph 6:20).
  </p>

  <h5>Adherence to Scripture</h5>

  <p>
    The Lamp is fiercely Bible-dependent and world-independent, adhering to scripture alone in all matters covered by scripture. We don't fall into strict political, economic or social categories, which means, from time to time, you may disagree with us on ideological grounds. We welcome your feedback, and we eagerly seek to correct our errors if they can be shown to exist based on sound biblical exegesis.
